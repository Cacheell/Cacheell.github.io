excerpt: 'What are the causal effects of parental wealth on children’s outcomes? Beginning with the famous land run of 1889, initial homesteaders in Oklahoma Territory raced to claim plots of land unaware that oil lay hidden beneath their feet. We link initial homesteaders to the locations of oil discoveries and develop new methods to link them to their children in the 1940 census, which allows us to examine the impacts of parental wealth shocks on children’s wealth, income, labor supply, education, and migration.'
