> We revisit the role of temporary layoffs in the business cycle. While many have emphasized a stabilizing effect due to recall hiring, we quantify from the data an important countercyclical destabilizing effect due to “loss-of-recall”, whereby workers in temporary-layoff unemployment lose their job permanently. We develop a quantitative model allowing for endogenous flows of workers across employment and both temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment. The model captures both pre- and post-pandemic unemployment dynamics, including the recessionary role of loss-of-recall. We use our structural model to show that the Paycheck Protection program generated sizable employment gains, in part by significantly reducing loss-of-recall.  

<br/>**The Labor Demand and Labor Supply Channels of Monetary Policy** (with Sebastian Graves and Eric T. Swanson) [[pdf]](https://christopher-huckfeldt.github.io/files/GHS2024.pdf) [[slides]](https://christopher-huckfeldt.github.io/files/GHS2024_slides.pdf) [[data]](https://github.com/Christopher-Huckfeldt/GHS_Labor_Flows) (See also [NBER WP31770](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31770))<br/>

> Monetary policy is conventionally understood to influence labor demand, with little effect on labor supply. We estimate the response of labor market flows to high-frequency changes in interest rates around FOMC announcements and Fed Chair speeches and find evidence that, in contrast to the consensus view, a contractionary monetary policy shock leads to a significant increase in labor supply: workers reduce the rate at which they quit jobs to non-employment, and non-employed individuals increase their job-seeking behavior. These effects are quantitatively important: holding supply-driven labor market flows constant, the decline in employment from a contractionary monetary policy shock would be twice as large. To interpret our findings, we estimate a heterogeneous agent model with frictional labor markets and an active labor supply margin. The model rationalizes existing estimates of small labor supply responses to idiosyncratic transfers with our new evidence of a large labor supply response to an aggregate shock.



## Work in progress

<br/>**The Marginal Efficiency of Active Search** [[slides]](https://christopher-huckfeldt.github.io/files/MEoAS_slides.pdf) (_Under revision with Seb Graves, see prior version [here](https://christopher-huckfeldt.github.io/files/MEoAS.pdf)._)<br/>  
> During recessions, a greater fraction of non-employed workers who want work actively search for a job. Simultaneously, the job-finding probabilities of such non-employed active searchers converge to those of the non-employed who want a job but are not engaged in any form of active search. I document these findings and show that they are symptomatic of a form of "crowding-out" of active search that has thus far gone unrecognized in the literature. I estimate a declining marginal efficiency of active search, and I establish that active search plays a less important role for finding a job during a recession.

<br/>**Reconciling Occupational Mobility in the Current Population Survey** (with Christian vom Lehn) [[journal version]](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/718563) <br/> 
_Journal of Labor Economics_, 2020     

Measuring occupational mobility from the Current Population Survey using retrospective or longitudinal methods generates substantially different outcomes, in both levels and trends. Using a generalized method of moments technique, we estimate the level of occupational mobility and the measurement error in both of these measures for 1981–2018. We estimate that occupational mobility has been trending down, particularly since 2000, consistent with retrospective measures of occupational mobility. However, estimated mobility is 2–3 percentage points or 60%–70% higher than retrospective measures. Measurement error in longitudinal measures is large and has been worsening over time.
